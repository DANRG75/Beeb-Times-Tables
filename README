DANRG75 Times Tables Test for the BBC Micro
-------------------------------------------

A simple spelling test for the BBC Micro, it just answers questions, using some random colours and repeats the question if the answer is input incorrectly. 

There is no time limit or end to the number of questions. This can be amusing or frustrating depending on the user...

FILES:
------

README - this file
times-tables-test - the BBC Basic source code
times.ssd - A BBC disk image containing the Basic programme and a !BOOT file

times.ssd should boot normally with shift-break else once the disk is loaded into the BBC, type:

CH."TEST"

TO-DO:
------

While the programme does work, it could do with some improvement:

Select times table - keep one factor consistent and the other random based on input.

Limit test -  ask 12 or 24 questions, give a total of right / wrong.

Record time - use time data to indicate performance?
